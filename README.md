# The Land of Thuul

This is the incredible open ended adventure that plays like the classic pen & paper dungeons, with a 1st edition feel (but 3rd ED. rules), and is best suited for single adventures with parties of 2-6 (traditional party). Range from levels 1 - 40. Dungeon focuses on light quests and heavy adventure. Module is based off my previous works but has been greatly expanded and upgraded.
